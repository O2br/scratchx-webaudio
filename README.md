[Open Scratchx with Audio Oscillator](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://yokobond.github.io/scratchx-audio/audio-oscillator.js)

### limitation
You can use one oscillator to make sound. 
(I couldn't manage instances of oscillator by blocks.)

These APIs are implemented at this time.

* start/stop a oscillator
* set the wave type of an oscillator
* set the frequency of an oscillator
* set the gain of an oscillator
